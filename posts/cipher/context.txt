This project is a group effort with Kevin Leidig, one of my friends at CU Boulder. He described to me a cipher he had created, and I decided I wanted to write a code for it so that we could translate typed text into his cipher. The cipher works as follows.
Arrange the letters of the alphabet on a grid (see figure 1). Each letter is represented by a position on the grid.

Now think of each letter as a direction from the center point (the m). Thus, the "m" would require no movement, the "h" requires moving up one, and the "a" is back two, up two. This movement can be inscrybed with lines and dashes (see figure 2). A movement of distance one from the center point just requires a line pointing in the direction of the movement. Any additional movement is represented by dashes attached to the line. A horizontal dash means moving up or down one more, and a vertical dash means moving left or right one more. Additionally, only forward directions can be represented (you will understand why later), so backward directions are represented by an unfilled circle (signaling to flip the direction).

This website is a celebration of my favorite color: gray. Its primary purpose is to create a captivating visual experience by emphasizing certain colors against a predominantly gray backdrop.
On the homepage, my name stands out vibrantly against the subdued gray background, creating a striking contrast. As the mouse cursor moves across the screen, the gray tiles beneath it come to life, illuminating the area where the mouse is positioned, making it easy for users to locate their cursor.
Built entirely from scratch using the Angular framework, this website seamlessly interacts with a back-end hosted on GitHub. While the back-end is elementary in its functionality, limited to supporting basic 'get' commands, it plays a pivotal role on the Projects page. Whenever a new project is posted, the front-end automatically updates, ensuring that visitors always have access to the latest information.
The front-end of the website is responsible for parsing the back-end data and presenting it to the user. It accomplishes this through a series of intuitive commands. For instance, if a line begins with '>>', the system interprets the subsequent content. If it encounters 'IMAGE', the following '>>' signifies the filename of the image, accompanied by a descriptive caption. For example, '>>IMAGE>>img1.png>>Figure 1: The GitHub logo' displays:
>>IMAGE>>img1.png>>Figure 1: The GitHub logo
Designed for flexibility, this website empowers me to effortlessly add new content or modify existing information. I encourage you to visit regularly to discover any exciting new projects that may have been added.

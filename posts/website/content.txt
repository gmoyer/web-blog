I've coded this website from scratch using an Angular framework to pull from a backend hosted in GitHub. The backend is elementary, and just holds information that the front end accesses. The backend is not capable of running programs, and only supports get commands. The backend is used for my projects page, and updates whenever a new project is posted. The forntend then parses the backend and displays it. It parses it via a series of commands that can be entered. If a line begins with a ">>", it then looks at what follows the double arrows. If that is IMAGE, then the next double arrows tell the filename of the image, and then an image description below the image. An example would be >>IMAGE>>img1.png>>Figure 1: The github logo. Shown below:
>>IMAGE>>img1.png>>Figure 1: The github logo

This project presents an innovative algorithm designed to unravel the mysteries of the popular game Clue. Leveraging the power of information theory, this algorithm is engineered to make optimal guesses, offering players a strategic advantage.
Here's how it works: The algorithm initially assigns equal probabilities to the possible locations of each card, as no information is known. As the game progresses and nonactive players make guesses, the algorithm records which players pass and who reveals their cards to other players. Every piece of this information is valuable and is stored for future use.
When it's the algorithm's turn to ask for information, it assigns the probability of a specific player revealing a card to the knowledge that would be gained from seeing that card. The algorithm then employs this principle to maximize the information gained with each turn, making choices that are statistically most likely to unveil vital clues.
However, it's important to acknowledge that this algorithm does come with certain limitations. Notably, the complexity of calculating the probabilities for card locations can demand substantial computational power. While this is less conspicuous in a three-player game, it becomes more pronounced in games involving four or five players. Currently, the algorithm exhaustively analyzes every scenario, a practice I aim to refine in the future.
Please note that this algorithm is an ongoing project, continuously evolving to overcome its limitations. While its user-friendliness may require further enhancement, I am committed to improving the user experience. Your valuable feedback is welcome and appreciated.

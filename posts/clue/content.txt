This project is an algorithm that solves the popular game Clue. It uses information theory to determine the best guesses to make. This is done as follows:
The algorithm assigns initial probabilities to where each card can exist. This is even across players. Whenever the active player makes a guess, the algorithm notes which players pass, and which players show the active player cards. All of this is information that can be saved. When the algorithm's turn is reached, it maps the probability of a specific player showing the algorithm a card to the information that would be gained from seeing that card. The algorithm maximizes this principle and makes the guess that is most likely to reveal the most information.
The algorithm I have built has many limitations. Primarily, the probabilities of where cards can exist get extremely complex. Thus, it can take a lot of computing power to determine these probabilities. This is less noticeable in a three player game, but becomes much more apparent in a four or five player game. Currently, the algorithm analyzes every possibility, which I want to change. The algorithm is still in progress, but it can be accessed below.

As of now, the algorithm is also not user friendly, so I am working to improve that in the future as well. Feel free to reach out to me with any feedback!
